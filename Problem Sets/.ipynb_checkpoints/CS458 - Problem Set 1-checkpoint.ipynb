    "# Problem 1 - News Story of Security Incident\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2018, USPS website exposed data on 60 millions users. Apparently, the problem originated from an authentication weakness in the USPS API that tied to a Postal Servive initiative called \"Informed Visibility\". It was meant for buinesses, advertisers, and other bulk mail senders to \"make better business decisions by providing them with access to near real-time tracking data\". As a result, anyone logged into the usps.com was able to query the system for account details belonging to any the users. Information such as email address, usernames, user IDs, street address, phone numbers, and etc were released or available to anyone. They were also able to modified said users information. \n",
    "\n",
    "This type of breach hit two of the big three security goals. There was definitely a loss of confidentiality since the website did not prevent unauthorized reading of information and there was a loss of integrity since the website did not prevent modification of the users' information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The article mentions that many of those that were aware of the problem were able to obtain anyone's information for any purpose. There was an example of a user indicating that they had moved away to a new location due to an issue with neighbors and if such a breach occurred, there location was now available to their own neighbors.

    "\n",
    "    I believe confidentiality would be important for both sides. A customer would be upset if the adversary was able to go within their accounts because of lack of confidentiality. Once the adversary has access to the account, they would be able to breach the integrity of the user by, for example, changing the password. This will obviously lead to an upset user and more problems for the bank."
