Thus, we are attempting to figure out plaintext 2 from the given information: plaintext 1 and ciphertext 1, and unknown plaintext 2 and cipher text 2. From the picture below, I tried examining the two cipher texts and realized there were a few similarities between them. For example, the ending trail of both ciphers are similar (outlined in blue). I tried mapping each character from known p1 to c1, but it doesn't seem to apply to c2. Either way, I'm sure a professional attack would be able to utilize this pair of (p1, c1) to figure out p2 from c2. OFB is suppose to a more safer form of encryption compared to CFB, which means that if I was able to see few similarities from using the same IV, then CFB would probably reveal even more.\n",
